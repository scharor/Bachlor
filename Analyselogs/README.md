# Loganalysis

In this folder are the Logfiles from the Landingtests i made.

What do i need to do to get startet?

1. install Python 

2. Change the file_path variable to the txt file you want to analyse and start it with python  analyis.py

delete.py is just for when you want to cut out a part of the script you can change the marker to what you want the end to be it needs to be alone in a line.
