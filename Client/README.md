# Client
Here is the Client that i used to create the Arb-Transactions.

What do you need to do to get started?

1. You need to put your Private Key into the wallet create Function in the script

2. If you want to use Helios or Alechemy you need to add that connection as well

3. Put your Birdeye Api key from the APi part into line 483 or you can make a own list

4. Run the Dockerfile and start it on your RPC (if you use a RPC provider you need to change the Validator IP in the Script)
